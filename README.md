## üì¶ Deployment to GitHub Pages

To deploy the site to GitHub Pages, you need to build the project and then push the updated `dist` directory to the `main` branch of your repository.

1. Ensure your repository is configured for GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

      - Go to Settings \> Pages.
      - Set Source to "Deploy from a branch".
      - Choose the `main` branch and the `/dist/public` folder.

2. Build the project for production. This will generate the static files in the `/dist/public` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Commit the changes, including the updated `dist` directory.

```bash
git add dist
git commit -m "Update build for deployment"
```

4. Push the changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin main
```

5. Your site will be available at https://biryanibong.github.io/ shortly after the push is complete and GitHub Pages finishes building.
